                The only Blog site out there that has what you need, from turning your life into the monoply game or tackeling the challanges of a road trip, we have it all!

                
GIVEN a personal blog
WHEN I load the app,
THEN I am presented with the landing page containing a form with labels and inputs for username, blog title, and blog content.
WHEN I submit the form,
THEN blog post data is stored to localStorage.
WHEN the form submits,
THEN I am redirected to the posts page.
WHEN I enter try to submit a form without a username, title, or content,
THEN I am presented with a message that prompts me to complete the form.
WHEN I view the posts page,
THEN I am presented with a header, with a light mode/dark mode toggle, and a "Back" button.
WHEN I click the light mode/dark mode toggle,
THEN the page content's styles update to reflect the selection.
WHEN I click the "Back" button,
THEN I am redirected back to the landing page where I can input more blog entries.
WHEN I view the main content,
THEN I am presented with a list of blog posts that are pulled from localStorage.
WHEN I view localStorage,
THEN I am presented with a JSON array of blog post objects, each including the post author's username, title of the post, and post's content.
WHEN I take a closer look at a single blog entry in the list,
THEN I can see the title, the content, and the author of the post.
WHEN I view the footer,
THEN I am presented with a link to the developer's portfolio.

While making thig blog it seems i got extremlly sidetracked from what the acceptance criteria wanted and what I made. I did get lost in the ideas i had in my head for the website I was making. 
I designed the bubble to be more like The New York times if Facebook made it. As now that I read what i was supposed to make The Bubble is far from that.

I do hope outisde of what me missing the mark you still like the website and can show me where to improve.

Thank You,

Mike Smith
